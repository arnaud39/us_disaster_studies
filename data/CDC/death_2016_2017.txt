Messages:
"1. Rows with suppressed Deaths are hidden, but the Deaths and Population values in those rows are included in the totals. Use"
"Quick Options above to show suppressed rows."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,"
"due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Unreliable."
"4. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More"
"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"5. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
