Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when location of Death's Occurrence, Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or"
"Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Unreliable."
"4. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"5. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"

"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"

"6. Deaths related to external causes of injury or sudden death: In the provisional mortality data, causes of death classified as"
